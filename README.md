# CCS2_Project_2025_CP-HumorNet
## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and results for a project from the *Course Computational Cognitive Science 2*, focused on the **Multimodal humor prediction** on UR-FUNNY:  
ðŸ‘‰ [UR-FUNNY](https://github.com/ROC-HCI/UR-FUNNY)



## Environment Setup

We use Google Colab to run the code. You can also
Install all required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All scripts can be run independently, as there is no single main entry point. Required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## File Structure

### Configuration and Scripts

- `requirements.txt`  
  Contains all Python dependencies.

- `FunnyNet-W.py`  
  The Python script runs modified FunnyNet-W.

- `Ourmodel.py`
